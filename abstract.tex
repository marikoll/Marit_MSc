Ozone depletion events (ODEs) caused by reactive halogens in the Arctic are a well known and thoroughly studied phenomena. The purpose of this thesis is to implement the chemistry that is lacking in the Oslo CTM3 (chemical transport model) in order to further analyse the effect these events may have on the radiative balance in the Arctic.
