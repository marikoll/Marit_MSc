Increased anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and methane causes production of ozone in the troposphere, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Tropospheric ozone acts as a greenhouse gas. Ozone depletion events (ODEs) caused by reactive halogens in the Arctic are a well known and thoroughly studied phenomena, which may modulate the warming effect of tropospheric ozone in the Arctic. The purpose of this thesis is to implement the halogen chemistry causing the ODEs in the Arctic, as they are currently lacking in the Oslo CTM3 (chemical transport model) and thereby attempt to reproduce the ODEs by comparing with observations. If the implementation produces reasonable results, the model can be used to further analyse the effect these events may have on the radiative balance in the Arctic.
