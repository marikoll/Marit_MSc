    \caption{Ozone in ppb (lines) simulated by a regional photochemical model as a function of emission rates of anthropogenic $\chem{NO_x}$ and hydrocarbons. The thick line separates the figure into $\chem{NO_x}$-limited (top left) and hydrocarbon limited (bottom right) regimes. Figure taken from \cite{Jacob1999} and \cite{Sillmann1990}.}
