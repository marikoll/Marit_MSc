\section{Code Development}\label{sec:discussion_code_development}

The Oslo CTM3 is documented by \cite{SovdeManual} and the documentation in the code. The branches developed in this thesis were based on the work done by \cite{Susanne} in her master thesis from 2016. The process was slowed down by quite some time due to the lack of documentation in the new code and my ability to interpret it. Also, due to the change of super computers in January 2020, some problems arose concerning how to optimize the model runs in technical terms (see Section \ref{app:supercomputer}). This led to the decision to perform the model runs at \texttt{HFOUR}-resolution instead of \texttt{HTWO} and shorten the time of the spin-up and the model runs to three months (model time). 

\medskip

Throughout the developing section, results will be compared against some proxy measurements, which are: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ozone measurements from EBAS for the stations with available data for 2001 (Alert, Barrow, Summit and Zeppelin) (see Figure \ref{tab:ebas_noaa_data_taken})
    \item Filterable \chem{BrO} (\chem{f-Br}) measurements from Alert (see Figure \ref{fig:Barrie_1988} taken from \cite{barrie})
    \item \chem{BrO}-\acrlong{vcd} measurements from Barrow (see Figure \ref{fig:Peterson_2015} taken from \cite{Peterson2015})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A First Look}

In Figure \ref{fig:CompObsOrigBE} (in Section \ref{sec:results_code_development}) the ozone observations at Alert, Barrow, Summit and Zeppelin were compared to model results using the original CTM3 branch (Branch \ref{def:origCTM3_PD}) and the bromine explosion branch (Branch \ref{def:BE_PD}). The latter produced far too low $\chem{O_3}$-concentrations even though the bromine content was too low to justify the low ozone-concentration (not shown here). In order to examine the reason why, a test where the different types of heterogeneous reactions were removed was performed. This is explained in the next section. 

\subsection{Test: Removing Heterogeneous Reactions}

Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noAerosol}-\ref{def:BE_PD_noBr} were created as an attempt to see which process may have caused the problems in the initial BE-branch (Branch \ref{def:BE_PD}). The resulting modelled ozone along with ozone measurements are shown in Figure \ref{fig:test_RemoveHetReacts}. When the heterogeneous reactions over ice surfaces were removed, the resulting modelled ozone content became similar to what was produced originally (by Branch \ref{def:BE_PD}), indicating that the problem had to be elsewhere. The other three branches produced ozone with comparable mixing ratios as the observed ozone content. Branches \ref{def:BE_PD_noAerosol} and \ref{def:BE_PD_noBr} resembles each other concerning the ozone-concentration, whereas Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} deviates and shows more sign of having some ozone-depletion patterns (e.g. around the 9th of April at Zeppelin). 

\medskip

The branch without heterogeneous chlorine reactions (Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl}) was chosen for further development as this was considered less invasive to the halogen-chemistry than to exclude the heterogeneous bromine chemistry or the heterogeneous aerosol chemistry. 

\medskip

Figures \ref{fig:vertHBr_noCl}-\ref{fig:polarHBr_noCl} shows the mixing ratio in the vertical and the concentration in the Arctic at the first model layer, respectively. Compared to the measurements of filterable bromine, \chem{f-Br}, performed by \cite{barrie}, the concentration shown in Figure \ref{fig:polarHBr_noCl} is too low (see Figure \ref{fig:Barrie_1988} in the Appendix). The same applies for the \chem{BrO} \acrshort{vcd} over the lowermost $\sim 250$ m shown in Figure \ref{fig:polarBrO_noCl}. Compared to the \acrshort{maxdoas}-measurements performed by \cite{Peterson2015} (see Figure \ref{fig:Peterson_2015} in Appendix) these are about a factor of $10^7$ too low. These low concentrations were focused upon in the further development of the branch. 
%This had to be seen in the context of the modelled bromine content as there generally was not enough bromine to create such low values of ozone. 



\subsection{Development of Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} Without Heterogeneous Chlorine Reactions}


\subsubsection{Initializing Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} With a Higher \chem{HBr} Concentration}\label{sec:disc_step2}

Figure \ref{fig:ozone_noCl_step2} contains the resulting ozone mixing ratio at the four different stations with ozone measurements from 2001 after performing the following tests on Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl}: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hard-coding the \chem{HBr}-concentration to being constantly 30 ppt 
    \item Hard-coding the \chem{HBr}-concentration to being constantly 10 ppt
    \item Initializing the run with a restart file (spin-up) from the run above (\chem{HBr}-concentration hard-coded to 10 ppt)
\end{itemize}

The first two tests were performed for the purpose of investigating whether a forced high concentration of \chem{HBr} would have any effect on the content of reactive bromine species and therefore possibly the production of \acrshort{ode}s. From Figure \ref{fig:ozone_noCl_step2} it is clear that the concentration of ozone is affected, with especially the forced 10 ppt-run following the measured $\chem{O_3}$ to a larger extent than before. 

\medskip

The run initialized with a restart file from the 10 ppt-\chem{HBr} concentration run was performed to allow the system to run in a more physical sense (i.e. avoid hard-coding) although containing more bromine. This run generally produced ozone concentrations that were slightly higher than measured. The \chem{HBr}-mixing ratio and concentration seen in Figures \ref{fig:vertHBr_newRestart}-\ref{fig:polarHBr_newRestart}, respectively, show that the content is about an order of magnitude to high compared to what was seen in Figure \ref{fig:Barrie_1988}. Thus, the bromine content has been boosted by the new initialization, but without any clear effects on the ozone concentrations. 

\medskip

The \chem{HBr}- and \chem{HOBr}-concentrations are closely linked and anti-correlated, as can be seen from Figures \ref{fig:polarHBr_newRestart}-\ref{fig:polarHOBr_newRestart}. A hypothesis for this behaviour could be that the \chem{HOBr} was titrated from the system, leaving hot spots of \chem{HBr}. The subsequent testing thus included two more reactions (Reactions \ref{rqn:oh_br2} and \ref{rqn:oh_hbr}) in order to cycle these species more efficiently. 

\medskip

The \chem{BrO}-\acrshort{vcd} shown in Figure \ref{fig:polarBro_newRestart} is still about 6 orders of magnitude too low compared to what could be expected from Figure \ref{fig:Peterson_2015}. The areas of elevated \chem{BrO} are, however related to areas of elevated \chem{HOBr} in Figure \ref{fig:polarHOBr_newRestart}, indicating that Reaction \ref{R:7} is indeed working. The low content could then be related to the inefficient cycling of \chem{HOBr}. 


\subsubsection{Hard-Coding Photodissociation and Adjusting the Henry'Law Coefficient}\label{sec:disc_step3}

Figure \ref{fig:ozone_2001_step3} contains the modelled results of four new tests, as well as the observational data, the original CTM3 and the last test from the previous section initialized with a \chem{HBr}-concentration of 10 ppt. The new tests included: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hard-coded photodissociation rates (Hard-coded P) as it turned out the photolysis of the following reactions were in fact not working prior to this
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $3\times10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$ for Reaction \ref{R:18} (value from \cite{CAO})
        \item $0.014$ s$^{-1}$ for Reaction \ref{R:20}(value from \cite{CAO})
        \item $0.05\times10^{-8}$ s$^{-1}$ for Reaction \ref{R:12} (value from \cite{Papanastasiou2013}, Arctic spring dissociation rate, Figure 2, p. 3022)
    \end{itemize}
    The rest of the tests contained this hard-coded rates. 
    \item A new Henry's law coefficient, as it turned out the previous coefficient had the wrong unit. The low Henry coefficient refers to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \chem{HBr}: $7.2\cdot 10^{-1} [M/amt]$, $6100 K$ (Taken from: \cite{Chameides1992})
    \end{itemize}   
    \item The high Henry's law coefficient refers to: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \chem{HBr}: $2.5 \cdot 10^{1} [M/amt]$, $370 K$ (Taken from: \cite{dean1999})
    \end{itemize}
    \item The higher Henry's law coefficient was finally kept in the final version of the CTM3, and was therefore used in the \texttt{HTWO}-test
\end{itemize}

The resulting modelled ozone mixing ratios from these runs are lower than the previous tests, although with variations (as opposed to the first run using Branch \ref{def:BE_PD} in Figure \ref{fig:CompObsOrigBE}). It could be expected that these tests produced lower ozone-concentrations, as especially the photodissociation rates are a key point in the ozone depletion at the point of Arctic spring, causing halogens to become reactive. The change in the Henry's law coefficient was essential as the previous implementation was wrong, but the high- and low coefficient produce quite similar $\chem{O_3}$-mixing ratios. 

\medskip

The mixing ratio of \chem{HBr} in the vertical and the Artcic concentration in Figure \ref{fig:vertHBr_HTWO_step3} and \ref{fig:polarHBr_HTWO_step3}, respectively shows that the \chem{HBr} concentration is still an order of magnitude too high compared to the findings by \cite{barrie} in Figure \ref{fig:Barrie_1988}. Furthermore, the anti-correlation between \chem{HBr} and \chem{HOBr} can still be seen in Figures \ref{fig:polarHBr_HTWO_step3} and \ref{fig:polarHOBr_HTWO_step3}. This suggests that \chem{HOBr} is still being titrated from the system. 

\medskip

Figure \ref{fig:polarBrO_HTWO_step3} shows that the \chem{BrO}-\acrshort{vcd} is still about five orders of magnitude lower than what was found by \cite{Peterson2015} (see Figure \ref{fig:Peterson_2015} in the Appendix). Thus, the \acrshort{vcd} has increased compared to the previous tests, but is still not quite the magnitude it should be, compared to litterature. 

\medskip

There are indications of a possible relation between the high \chem{HOBr}-concentrations at Alert and the low ozone mixing ratio seen at the same time period in Figure \ref{fig:ozone_2001_step3}. It can also be seen from \ref{fig:polarBrO_HTWO_step3} that there is an elevated \acrshort{vcd} of \chem{BrO} at Alert in the same  time-period

\subsection{Higher Henry's Law Coefficient and Higher Photodissociation of \chem{HOBr}}\label{sec:disc_step4}

Originally, the Henry coefficient from the previous section was intended to be the one used in the final version. However, in order to perform the final runs in a way that would be reasonable to compare against the original version of the CTM3 as well as use in calculations of RF, the restart file provided from \cite{StefaniePersonal} (see Section \ref{subsec:restart_files}) was to be used for the 6 months runs at \texttt{HTWO} for all versions (Pre - industrial with original CTM3 version and \acrshort{be}-version, present - day with original CTM3 version and \acrshort{be}-version). The model crashed when running the final version of the \acrshort{be}-branch, obtaining negative values of \texttt{ISOR1} (a radical species) after 17 hours run time (i.e. not model time). After analyzing the results that the model was able to produce before crashing, I decided to attempt increasing the wet deposition of \chem{HBr} (increasing Henry's law coefficient) as well as increasing the photodissociation of \chem{HOBr}. 

% Skriv inn hva det endte opp med her med kilder

The pre-industrial \acrshort{be}-version had been able to run with the version from the section above, but experienced the same problem when running with the version in this section. Thus, the 6-month run from the previous section was kept. This does not serve as a good basis for calculating a trustworthy RF, but due to time limitations, this was what was used. 

\medskip

The original version of the CTM3 was able produce the model runs as planned, both for present-day- and pre-industrial runs. 

\subsubsection{Analysis of the Results Against the Proxy Measurements}

Figure \ref{fig:ozone_2001_step4} shows the resulting ozone mixing at the four different stations. The final version (green line) is the version that will be used for further analysis. The initial lower mixing ratio values produced by the final version could be due to the need for spin up, as the restart file initializing the model contains a chemistry that differs from what I have implemented. The stabilization of the ozone mixing ratio around 10-20 ppb is a bit low at all stations, but comparable to what was measured at Alert and Barrow, however with less oscillations. At Summit, the mixing ratio is about 30 ppb too low. Seen in relation with Figure \ref{fig:vertHBr_step4}, there is an increase in \chem{HBr} at about 800 hPa on the 5th of Mar followed by a decrease and minimum at around the 10th of May. This could correspond to the decrease in ozone followed by an increase in approximately the same time period in Figure \ref{fig:ozone_2001_step4}. At Zeppelin, the  %Naturlig at det tar litt tid for at det skal stabilisere seg, fordi restartfila har helt forskjellig kjemi --> burde hatt en spin up både for HTWO og ny kjemi

\section{Analysis of the Final Version of the Halogen Branch}\label{sec:disc_final_Version}

\subsection{Analysis of the Two Periods February-April and April-June}\label{sec:disc_twoPeriods}

\subsection{Analysis of the Difference Between the Final BE-Branch and the Original CTM3}\label{sec:disc_origBE}

The correlations between the model results (BE-branch and the original CTM3) for the Periods 1 and 2 shown in Figures \ref{fig:joint_FebApr_ALTSUM}-\ref{fig:joint_AprMay_ZEPBRW} generally depicts poor agreement between both the models and the observational data. There are no correlations above 0.5, and the correlation coefficient varies between being negative and positive. Also the correlations between the Original CTM3 and the observational data appears to be slightly higher (and more significant) for most of the stations. 


\section{Radiative Forcing}\label{sec:disc_RF}

\section{Future work}

The acidity of the reaction surface for the heterogeneous reactions are not considered, although it is highly dependent on pH. 

\medskip
Sea salt debromination increase from pre-industrial times to today due to enhanced particle acidity from present day emmissions are not considered here (\cite{Parella})

\medskip
The implementation in Section \ref{sec:oceanic_emissions} does not take into consideration antropogenic emissions of organic halocarbons, seasonality in emissions or the difference in lifetime for $\chem{CHBr_3}$ and $\chem{CH_2Br_2}$. The implementation is a latitudinal fixed parameterization, and cannot thus not interchange with existing inventories in the model. It would have been better to use an NetCDF-based emission field. 
\medskip
In the implementation of the heterogeneous reactions over snow and ice (Section \ref{sec:tropchem_oslo}), the existence of sea ice is the only variable determining the occurrence of the reaction. To improve this, the age of the ice (multiyear ice or newly formed ice), snow cover and ph should be considered (e.g. \cite{Peterson2019}).

\medskip

The model should also be verified for the Antarctic, which also experiences ODEs (\cite{Simpson2015}).


\medskip

The parameterization of the aerodynamic resistance $r_a$ in Sections \ref{sec:snow_ice_react} should have been calculated using values for the boundary layer conditions, wind speed and boundary layer height, that are in the CTM3 already, rather than prescribed values from \cite{CAO}.
