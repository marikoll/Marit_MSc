The final \acrlong{be}-branch which includes the halogen chemistry necessary to initiate \acrlong{ode}s in the Arctic produces highly unstable and varying results regarding the ozone content of the troposphere when compared to observations both at the ground level and in the vertical. The BE-branch shows no significant correlation with ground-based measurements of ozone.
