    \caption{Concentration ($g m^{-3}$) of \chem{HBr} in the first model layer the Arctic at 18:00 and 06:00 (UTC) of the 22nd, 23rd and 24th of April, 2001. The result is from the test including hard-coded photodissociation rates as well as a new (high) Henry-coefficient at HFOUR resolution. The red dots are the positions of the stations with observations in 2001 (see the map in Figure \ref{fig:stns} for reference)}
