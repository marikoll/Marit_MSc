    \caption{Vertical column density ($molecules cm^{-2}$) of \chem{BrO} in the lowermost $\sim 250 m$ at 18:00 and 06:00 (UTC) on the  2nd, 3rd and 4th of May, 2001. The result is from Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} initialized with a new restart file with a \chem{HBr} concentration of 10 ppt. The red dots are the positions of the stations with observations in 2001 (see the map in Figure \ref{fig:stns} for reference)}
