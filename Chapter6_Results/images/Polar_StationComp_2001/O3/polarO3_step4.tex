    \caption{Concentration ($g m^{-3}$) of $\chem{O_3}$ in the first model layer the Arctic at 18:00 and 06:00 (UTC) of the  22nd, 23rd and 24th of April, 2001. The result is from Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} initialized with a new restart file with a \chem{HBr} concentration of 10 ppt. The red dots are the positions of the stations with observations in 2001 (see the map in Figure \ref{fig:stns} for reference)}
