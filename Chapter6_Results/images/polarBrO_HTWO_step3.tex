    \caption{Vertical column density ($molecules cm^{-2}$) of \chem{BrO} in the lowermost $\sim 250 m$ at 18:00 and 06:00 (UTC) of the 27th, 28th and 29th of April, 2001. The result is from the test including hard-coded photodissociation rates as well as a new (high) Henry-coefficient at HFOUR resolution. The red dots are the positions of the stations with observations in 2001 (see the map in Figure \ref{fig:stns} for reference)}
