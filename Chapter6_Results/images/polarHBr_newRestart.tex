    \caption{Concentration ($g m^{-3}$) of \chem{HBr} in the first model layer the Arctic in the morning and evening (UTC) of the 9th and the 10th of April, 2001. The result is from Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} initialized with a new restart file with a \chem{HBr} concentration of 10 ppt. The red dots are the positions of the stations with observations in 2001 (see the map in Figure \ref{fig:stns}}
