    \caption{Mixing ratio ($mol mol^{-1}$) of \chem{HBr} in the model layers up to $\sim 600 hPa$ at the four different stations Alert (top left), Barrow (top right), Zeppelin (lower left) and Summit (lower right) in April-May, 2001. The result is from Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} initialized with a new restart file with a \chem{HBr} concentration of 10 ppt}
