    \caption{Vertical column density ($molecules cm^{-2}$) of \chem{BrO} in the lowermost $\sim 250 m$ at 12:00 and 00:00 (UTC) on the 20th, 21st and 22nd of April, 2001. The result is from Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} initialized with a new restart file with a \chem{HBr} concentration of 10 ppt. The red dots are the positions of the stations with observations in 2001 (see the map in Figure \ref{fig:stns} for reference)}
