\section{Code Development}\label{sec:results_code_development}

This section contains some results 

Test-runs are between 14- and 20 (model) days, production runs are 1-3 (model) months

\subsection{A First Look}

Figure \ref{fig:CompObsOrigBE} shows results in terms of $\chem{O_3}$-concentration from preliminary model runs with the chemistry described in Chapter \ref{Chap:CTM3theory_ocean_hetReact} and the branches listed in Section \ref{sec:code_availability}. 

\medskip

To verify the results, I have used the measurements of $\chem{O_3}$ and \chem{HBr} available (see Appendix \ref{app:ebas_noaa_data}), as well as \chem{BrO} measurements from literature for comparison. Ozone is used as a proxy as it was reproducability of the ODEs seen in measurements I was interested in. The \chem{HBr} measurements should in theory correspond to elevated concentrations after an ODE according to the box-model results by \cite{CAO}. Finally, \chem{BrO}-concentrations should be anti-correlated with the depletion of ozone (\cite{barrie}). 

\medskip

Branch \ref{def:BE_PD} produces very low concentrations of $\chem{O_3}$, as can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:CompObsOrigBE}. It does not capture the ozone depletion events that can be seen for instance at Alert around the 9th of April. The original CTM3 branch produced $\chem{O_3}$ concentrations more comparable to observations, although without distinct bromine explosion events.

\subsection{Test: Removing Heterogeneous Reactions}

Figure \ref{fig:test_RemoveHetReacts} shows results in terms of $\chem{O_3}$-concentration from attempting to turn off different heterogeneous reactions, namely snow/ice reactions (described in Section \ref{sec:snow_ice_react}), heterogeneous reactions over aerosol surfaces (described in Section \ref{sec:aerosol_react}) as well as heterogeneous reactions involving chlorine and bromine, respectively. The runs were initiated with the same restart file (spin-up) as Branch \ref{def:BE_PD}. For this purpose, four new branches were created (for a full overview of the branches, see Table \ref{tab:branches}). These were:

\begin{mydef}\label{def:BE_PD_noAerosol}
    \texttt{marikoll\_bromine\_explosion\_noHetAerosol}: Branch \ref{def:BE_PD} without heterogeneous aerosol reactions (Reaction \ref{R:8}). 
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}\label{def:BE_PD_noIce}
    \texttt{marikoll\_bromine\_explosion\_noSnowIce}: Branch \ref{def:BE_PD} without heterogeneous reactions over ice surfaces (called \texttt{noSnowIce} by mistake) (Reaction \ref{R:7}).
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}\label{def:BE_PD_noCl}
    \texttt{marikoll\_bromine\_explosion\_noHetChlorine}: Branch \ref{def:BE_PD} without heterogeneous reactions involving chlorine (Reaction \ref{R:8} and \ref{R:7} with $\chem{X} = \chem{Cl}$).
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}\label{def:BE_PD_noBr}
    \texttt{marikoll\_bromine\_explosion\_noHetBromine}: Branch \ref{def:BE_PD} without heterogeneous reactions involving bromine (Reaction \ref{R:8} and \ref{R:7} with $\chem{X} = \chem{Br}$).
\end{mydef}

In the vertical, the corresponding $\chem{Br_y}$ concentrations to Figure \ref{fig:test_RemoveHetReacts} are shown in Figures \ref{fig:vert_noAer_bry_2001}-\ref{fig:vert_noBr_bry_2001} for the four new branches, Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noAerosol}-\ref{def:BE_PD_noBr}, respectively (The $\chem{Br_y}$-family is explained in Section \ref{sec:halogen_families_BryClxCly}).

\textbf{NOTE:} after these tests, a mistake in the scaling of $\chem{Cl_x}$ was discovered. \chem{BrCl} had mistakenly been scaled with this family, which led to disappearance of all \chem{Cl}-species. The subsequent tests were fixed for this.

\subsection{Integrating $\chem{Cl_y}$ in Branch \ref{def:BE_PD}}

Figure \ref{fig:test_ClyInt} contains the result in terms of $\chem{O_3}$ concentration where an integration of the $\chem{Cl_y}$-family was added to the initial BE-branch (Branch \ref{def:BE_PD}) This integration was not handled prior to the previous model runs (the chemical families are listed in Section \ref{sec:halogen_families_BryClxCly}). 

\medskip

As the inclusion of $\chem{ClONO2}$ (Reaction \ref{R:clono2}) function purely as a sink to the $\chem{ClO}$, this reaction was also removed altogether to see if this would help the low chlorine levels.

\subsection{Development of Branch \ref{def:BE_PD_noCl} Without Heterogeneous Chlorine Reactions}



\subsubsection{Changing $L_{mix}$ in Reaction \ref{R:7}}

The boundary layer height, $L_{mix}$ and deposition velocity, $v_d$ in the preliminary runs had values listed in Section \ref{sec:impl_multiphase_react}. In an attempt to "kick-start" the bromine explosions $L_{mix}$ was lowered (And corresponding $v_d$ increased) in the \texttt{marikoll\_bromine\_explosion\_noHetChlorine}- branch. 

\medskip

The first test was executed with $L_{mix} = 25 m$ and $v_d = 0.00824 m/s$. This boundary layer height was chosen due to the height of the second model layer height $995.86 hPa$, with is about $23 m$ higher than the first model layer height at $998.82 hPa$. The low level was chosen to make sure the bromine explosion would indeed occur. This test caused too much bromine explosion for the model to complete the run. $L_{mix}$ was then lowered to $L_{mix} = 100 m$ with $v_d = 0.00667 m/s$. 

\subsubsection{Lmix = 200}

\subsubsection{Lmix = 100}

\subsubsection{Lmix = 100 After Fix}

The weighing of Reaction \ref{R:7} was removed (in \texttt{pchemc\_ij.f90}). It was initially weighted with $0.5$ assuming half of the \chem{HOBr} was reacting with \chem{Br} and half with \chem{Cl}, but was removed as the heterogeneous reactions involving \chem{Cl} were removed. Also, $\chem{Br_2}$ was added to the debugging-scaling in \texttt{pchemc\_ij.f90}

\subsubsection{Lmix = 100, \chem{HBr} Adjusted to 30 ppt}

In order to boost the concentration of \chem{HBr}, the concentration was hard-coded to 30 ppt ($= 8.059 \text{molecules}cm^{-3}$ at $273.15 K$) in the first sub-timestep of \texttt{pchemc\_ij.f90}. This worked in the test-run


\subsubsection{Lmix = 200, \chem{HBr} Adjusted to 10 ppt}

A test-run of this managed to maintain 10 ppt - concentrations of \chem{HBr}, but longer runs crashed. Because the 10 ppt was maintained, a restart file was kept from the test-run to boost the concentration in a longer run (without hard-coding of the \chem{HBr} concentration)


\subsubsection{Lmix = 100, with new restart file}

Figur med HOBr og HBr - antikorrelert. Null effekt på ozon, hot spots med Br, BrO og Br2. 

The anticorrelation of \chem{HOBr} and \chem{HBr} indicates that \chem{HOBr} is titrated from the system, leaving hot spots of \chem{HBr}. 

\subsubsection{Lmix = 50, with new restart file}

Still anti-correlation between \chem{HOBr} and \chem{HBr}. Maybe a bit less $\chem{O_3}$?

\subsubsection{Lmix = 100, cycling of \chem{HOBr} and \chem{HBr} and hard-coded photodissociation rates}

C3RUN\_BE\_HFOUR\_HBr10ppt\_Lmix100\_ohbr2 - test run with the reaction: 

\begin{reaction}
    \chem{Br_2} + \chem{OH} \rightarrow \chem{HOBr} + \chem{Br}
    \label{rqn:oh_br2}
\end{reaction}

C3RUN\_BE\_HFOUR\_HDP\_MarchMay - long run with the reaction: 

\begin{reaction}
    \chem{HBr} + \chem{OH} \rightarrow \chem{H_2O} + \chem{Br}
    \label{rqn:oh_hbr}
\end{reaction}

As well as hard-coded photodissociation rates as it turned out the rates were not previously calculated for Reactions \ref{R:18}, \ref{R:20} and \ref{R:12}. These were previously set to be solved by the fast-JX method (see Section \ref{sec:CTM3_photochemistry}), but this had not worked. Instead, these were hard-coded as was done previously (by \cite{Susanne}) for Reactions \ref{R:19} and \ref{R:1}. The photodissociation rates were set to: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $3\cdot10^{-4} s^{-1}$ for Reaction \ref{R:18} (value from \cite{CAO})
    \item $0.014 s^{-1}$ for Reaction \ref{R:20}(value from \cite{CAO})
    \item $0.05\cdot10^{-8} s^{-1}$ for Reaction \ref{R:12} (value from \cite{Papanastasiou2013}, Arctic spring dissociation rate, Figure 2, p. 3022)
\end{itemize}


Testen viser bedring, men \chem{HBr} er fortsatt altfor høy- for treig våtavsetning? 

\subsubsection{Lmix = 100, new Henry's law constants for \chem{HBr} and \chem{HCl}}\label{sec:new_henrys_law}

New values for Henry's law constants were applied to fix the high concentrations seen in \chem{HBr}. The values were taken from \cite{dean1999}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \chem{HBr}: $2.5 \cdot 10^{1} [M/amt]$, $370 K$
    \item \chem{HCl}: $1.9\cdot10^1 [M/atm]$, $600 K$ 
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparison with literature}

\cite{Zhao2016} measured BrO column at Eureka in 2011 -- SJekk ut! 


\cite{Peterson2016} and \cite{Peterson2015} -- BrO over Barrow -- sjekk ut! 

Measurements of $\chem{Br_2}$, \chem{BrCl} and $\chem{O_3}$ were conducted by \cite{Foster2001} at Alert research station. They found $\chem{Br_2}$ mixing ratios up to $\sim$ 25 \acrshort{ppt} and \chem{BrCl} at mixing ratios up to 35 \acrshort{ppt} between day 40 and 75 in 2001. Ozone was depleted from background values of $\sim$ 30-40 \acrshort{ppb} to below 10 ppb. 

\medskip

\cite{Simpson2017} investigated the \chem{BrO} column using \acrlong{maxdoas} instrumentation near Barrow in 2012.

\medskip

\cite{Luo2018} also investigated the \chem{BrO} column using \acrshort{maxdoas} in Ny Ålesund in 2015.
