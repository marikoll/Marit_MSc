\section{Comparison with literature}

Measurements of $\chem{Br_2}$, \chem{BrCl} and $\chem{O_3}$ were conducted by \cite{Foster2001} at Alert research station. They found $\chem{Br_2}$ mixing ratios up to $\sim$ 25 \acrshort{ppt} and \chem{BrCl} at mixing ratios up to 35 \acrshort{ppt} between day 40 and 75 in 2001. Ozone was depleted from background values of $\sim$ 30-40 \acrshort{ppb} to below 10 ppb.

\cite{Simpson2017} investigated the \chem{BrO} column using \acrlong{maxdoas} instrumentation near Barrow in 2012.

\cite{Luo2018} also investigated the \chem{BrO} column using \acrshort{maxdoas} in Ny Ã…lesund in 2015.
