I would first and foremost like to thank my main supervisor Terje, for always having a couple of minutes when all seems desperate. Your theoretical support and discussions has been extremely appreciated. A big thanks to Stefanie as well for answering patiently to big and small questions and bringing order to overwhelming chaos. Also, my supervisor at Cicero, Marianne, has provided me with invaluable help.

Mamma, pappa and Elisabeth deserves a gold medal for always providing a safe space. Your moral support has been invaluable throughout these years, and I love you all very much!

Lastly, but no less, I would like to thank Ingvild, Johanne, Hanne, Hanna, Hanna for being the best friends anyone could ask for. You are there when I need to sing and dance, run, drink wine or laugh, and have made my life a great deal easier. A special thanks to my dear friend Inger Johanne who never misses a single detail, and is ever-intrigued. Without you there's no me.
